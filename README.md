# OctoMagicHat
This is a mechatronic-costume project developed &amp; constructed by myself for the course ME4250 Mechatronics at the University of Chile . It is a magic hat that conceals a small 3D-printed octopus. Using servo motors, the hat performs a small interaction with the octopus through an open-loop control system developed for the Arduino platform.
